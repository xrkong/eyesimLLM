[
  {
    "name": "VWStraight",
    "description": "Drive straight.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "dist": {
          "type": "integer",
          "description": "The distance to drive forward in mm."
        },
        "lin_speed": {
          "type": "integer",
          "description": "The linear speed of the vehicle in mm/s."
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "VWTurn",
    "description": "Turn left or right.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "angle": {
          "type": "integer",
          "description": "The angle to turn in degrees."
        },
        "ang_speed": {
          "type": "integer",
          "description": "The angular speed of the vehicle in degrees/s."
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "VWWait",
    "description": "Suspend current thread until drive operation has finished."
  }
]
You should only respond in this format:
[
{
    "function": {function_name},
    "properties": {property: value}
},
{
    "function": function_name,
    "properties": {property: value},
