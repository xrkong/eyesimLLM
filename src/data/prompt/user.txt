Drive the robot straight and collision-free close to the wall in front, then turn to the right, so it is parallel to the wall (at the robot’s left-hand side) in about 15cm distance. Then let the robot drive a “lawnmower pattern”, covering the whole
surface area. The robot will start from a random position and orientation. The robot should detect the end of the area and stop there.
